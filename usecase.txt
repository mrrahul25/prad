6. **Transportation:**
   - **Predictive Maintenance:** Pattern recognition is applied to analyze patterns of equipment failures or malfunctions in transportation systems. Anomaly detection helps predict when maintenance is needed, reducing downtime and enhancing system reliability.

7. **Energy Sector:**
   - **Fault Detection in Power Grids:** Pattern recognition is used to detect patterns indicative of faults or abnormalities in power grids. Anomaly detection helps in identifying unusual energy consumption patterns that may suggest a malfunction or unauthorized access.

8. **Telecommunications:**
   - **Network Monitoring:** Pattern recognition is applied to monitor network traffic and identify patterns associated with network congestion, performance issues, or security threats. Anomaly detection helps in identifying abnormal behaviors.

9. **Human Resources:**
   - **Employee Monitoring:** Pattern recognition is used for analyzing employee performance metrics and identifying patterns associated with high-performing or underperforming employees. Anomaly detection helps in identifying unusual behaviors or activities.

10. **Environmental Monitoring:**
    - **Air Quality Monitoring:** Pattern recognition is applied to analyze patterns in air quality data. Anomaly detection helps in identifying unusual spikes or drops in pollution levels, indicating potential environmental issues.

11. **Social Media and Content Moderation:**
    - **Content Filtering:** Pattern recognition is used to identify patterns associated with inappropriate or harmful content on social media platforms. Anomaly detection helps in flagging unusual or malicious activities.
